# Just A Randomizer
Just A Randomizer (JAR in short) is as its name implies just a randomizer that takes certain amounts of names from user input and assign them points based on a "lap" like system. is up to the user to decide if the name with the less points "wins" or "loses".

You as an user can save the results (or not) in a json format file, because of this although you dont need it, it is recomended to put the executable in an empty folder for comfort.
